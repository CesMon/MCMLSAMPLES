# RAW Reconstruction
This sample shows the process of reconstructing RAW data located in CMS Open Data Portal.

To start, first create a [VM](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/252 "CMS Open Data Portal") from the CMS Open Data website.

Then follow these steps:

- Create a CMSSW environment: 

    ```
    cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_32
    ```

- Change to the CMSSW_5_3_32/src/ directory:

    ```
    cd CMSSW_5_3_32/src/
    ```

- Initialize the CMSSW environment:

  ```
  cmsenv
  ```   

- Note that we need to be able to locate the database conditions as required by the *--conditions* switch.  Therefore, we need to make the following
 symbolic links:

```
ln -sf /cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/FT_53_LV5_AN1_RUNA FT_53_LV5_AN1

ln -sf /cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/FT_53_LV5_AN1_RUNA.db FT_53_LV5_AN1_RUNA.db
```

- Make sure the `cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch` directory has actually expanded in your VM.  One way of doing this is executing:

```
ls -l
ls -l /cvmfs/
```
